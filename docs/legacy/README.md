# Legacy Documentation

> **OUTDATED.** These documents are preserved for historical context only.

## Warning

Documents in this folder describe **previous versions** of ENOQ architecture.

**DO NOT use for implementation.**

## Canonical Documentation

For current architecture, see:
- [docs/INDEX.md](../INDEX.md) - Documentation entrypoint
- [docs/REPO_CONTRACT.md](../REPO_CONTRACT.md) - Repository rules
- [AXIS/](../../AXIS/) - Constitutional ground (frozen)

## Contents

| File | Version | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| V3_1_INVARIANTS.md | v3.1 | Old invariants (superseded by AXIS) |
| V4_ROUTING.md | v4.0 | Chow's Rule routing |
| V5_1_ROUTING.md | v5.1 | Unified gating (now in operational/) |
| Gate_v2_Academic_Paper.docx | v2 | Academic paper draft |
| ARCHITECTURE_TOTAL_SYSTEM_OUTDATED.md | pre-v6 | Old total architecture |
| INTEGRATION_PHILOSOPHY_OUTDATED.md | pre-v6 | Old philosophy docs |
| README_ENOQ_OUTDATED.md | pre-v6 | Old README |

## Why Keep These?

1. **Audit trail**: Understanding evolution
2. **Research**: Comparing approaches
3. **Recovery**: If we need to revisit old decisions

## Migration Notes

- v3.1 invariants → now in `AXIS/INVARIANTS.md`
- v4.0/v5.1 routing → now in `operational/gating/unified_gating.ts`
- Total architecture → now in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
